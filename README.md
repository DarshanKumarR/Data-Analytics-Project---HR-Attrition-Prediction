# Data-Analytics-Project---HR-Attrition-Prediction

“To predict the future attrition on the collected human resource data”

Today attrition is one of the major problems faced by industry across the world. It is the most burning issue for the industry, and high attrition rates lead to many issues in the boundary of the organization like losing the talents and knowledge, cost related to training and administration, and recruitment. It is observed that many attributes lead to the attrition of an employee like time spent, salary, accidents, promotions, projects, etc…, Also, the prediction model plays an essential role in finding the behaviour of employees.
Aim of the project: To identify the feature affecting employee’s attrition and predict the future attrition.

Objectives of the project:  The reasons for the attrition are somehow complicated, and that they differ from organization to organization and from country to country, reckoning on the work culture. The main objective of the project is to find out the features affecting attrition and how we can reduce the attrition rate in the future.

CountPlot
Countplot is basically a count of frequency plot in form of a bar graph. It plots the count of each category in a separate bar. When we use the pandas’ value counts function on any column, It is the same visual form of the value counts function. In our data-target variable is left and it is categorical so  we used countplot
Bar Plot
Bar plot is a simple plot which we can use to plot categorical variable on the x-axis and numerical variable on y-axis and explore the relationship between both variables.
Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y)

What is the Support Vector Machine?
“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression challenges.
Decision Tree Classification Algorithm
o	Decision Tree is a supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems.
Logistic Regression in Machine Learning
o	Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the
